        <h1>the education problem</h1>
        <p>
          Education is a large and nuanced field. Yet the quote above, taken
          from It’s Time to Build by Marc Andreessen, contains the essence of
          the challenge: quality and scale.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h4>quality</h4>
          <p>
            More knowledge than Newton or Galileo could have dreamed of is
            accesible via the internet-connected devices in our pockets. We
            support projects that help unlock this potential.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>scale</h4>
          <p>
            “We have top-end universities with the capacity to teach only a
            microscopic percentage of the 120 million new 18-year-olds in the
            world each year. Why not educate every 18-year-old? Isn’t that the
            most important thing we can possibly do?” Andreessen again. We
            couldn’t put it better. We support projects that aim to massively
            scale access to high-quality learning.
